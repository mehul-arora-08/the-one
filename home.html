				I know this is repetitive, but it's still crazy for me to think that it's only been around 2 weeks since we started talking again, and I'm already at the point where I can't get you out of my head. Why is it so easy to fall for you? You know, I'd already thought we'd never talk again. It's not the first time I'd thought that. But despite all odds, here we are. 
				<br><br>
				28 April 2017. Or 17 May. Or whenever we decided it was. The school bus yard. Talking about hangouts. The grin on my face refused to leave. Neither did I want you to. It was perfect, that moment. All the happiness in the world. For the first time in years, I didn't feel alone. I felt like I had someone who knew me. Someone who understood me. Someone who complemented my flaws. Someone who I could blindly trust. I had you.  
				<br><br>
				I distinctly remember 23rd September 2017. And then 14th October. The former being the first time I cried in school. Still probably the hardest day to get through. Couldn't do much, couldn't say much. My mind fell into pieces. All I could do was feel a strain inside my body. Struggling to get things back to the way they were. Even consoling myself that we were probably not "meant to be together", and it was just teenage dating and didn't mean much. But it did. It still does. The bond between that someone and I broke. I tried to hold everything back. "She hates you, you're an idiot", I thought to myself. Why would you even think of getting back with her?
				<br> <br>
				Fast forward 15 months. 11 January 2019. I get a text from someone saying "I miss you". I couldn't handle it. Why now? Why after all this time? I had to force my mind off it. Literally ignored your texts. But it felt right. We were already at our worst. Could only get better from here couldn't it? The 5 hour long phone call. Things are cleared up. I feel good. I feel happy. I feel satisfied. The barrier broke. I couldn't hold anything back. 
				<br><br>
				As I write this right now, I'm not even going to edit anything out. Because I was all I felt. It's now 4 AM as I write this and while I should be studying, I just can't. Not until this is done. It's all been on my mind for so long. The smallest of things. That cup of Ice cream at Giani's.That smile I gave you as you walked away on the 23rd. The phone call from Mumbai. Our first kiss. You being my first call to tell about KVPY. Me hating myself everytime I realised how much I still felt for you. 
				<br><br>
				But as I write this right now, what I do know is that I'm once again, hopelessly, irretrievably in love with you. Do what feels right, haina? This feels right. I've not felt this positive once throughout school life. What I do know right now, is that being with you makes me stronger than ever. It gives me the strength to fight through the worst of moods.  
				<br><br> 
				And there's another thing I'm going to write out to you because I still don't have the strength to discuss it. I know I'll leave soon. I have to. But I want to make up for the year we lost in the 6 months we have. We're not off to a bad start you know? Where we are after two weeks is insane, didn't see this coming. We've come a long way, and I would love for you to be with me again. 
				<br><br>
				Oh and hey. Once you're done reading this, do me a favour and type out the letters of your name on the keyboard. You might be surprised. <br><br><br>
